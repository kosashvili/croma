# Introduction

The Lumos Design System uses design tokens as the single source of truth for all foundational styles across web, iOS, and Android platforms. Tokens encode colors, typography, spacing, borders, units, layout, and strings into reusable variables that make UI consistent, scalable, and easy to maintain.\
\
All tokens are managed as Figma variable collections and can be edited directly via the Croma Figma plugin, which provides a seamless workflow for both designers and developers.\
\
Lumos tokens are organized into two layers:\
&#x9;1\.	Primitives (Global) – raw values such as hex colors, font families, unit sizes.\
&#x9;2\.	Aliases – contextual tokens mapped to UI usage (e.g., Background/Default, Text/Primary).
